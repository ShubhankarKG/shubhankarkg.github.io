    title: "About Me",
    introduction: "<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Shubhankar Gupta<\/strong>, 21 years old, living in Badlapur, Maharashtra.<\/p>",
    content: `<p>Currently, I am pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology from <a href='https://vjti.ac.in' rel='noopener noreferer' target='_blank'>Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute.</a> I am always committed to learning new and disruptive technologies. Learning new technologies brought me into Open Source, and I have loved every commit that has made a change in someone's life.<\/p>\n
              <p>In the summer of '21, I interned in JP Morgan Chase & Co. where I worked on technologies like React, Spring Boot and Jenkins. I have previously interned at Hyfunn Technologies LLP, where I was in charge of developing a PWA for the product and communicating with the backend team. During both of these internships, I took efforts to study how the product has been scaling, and how the cloud providers have been one of the significant impact-makers.<\/p>\n

              <p>I am also learning leadership skills, and have taken up multiple places of responsibilites. In the Academic Year 2020-21, I was the General Secretary of <a href="https://communityofcoders.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Of Coders</a>, a community aimed at imparting knowledge and wisdom from seniors to juniors. I was also the Cloud Computing Co-Head at <a href="https://www.dscvjti.tech//" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Developer Student Clubs</a>, where I taught multiple concepts of Computer Networking and Cloud Computing.<\/p>\n
              <p>I am also the Student Placement Coordinator at Training & Placement Office, VJTI, where we work closely with the on campus companies to ensure that all students leave the campus with a Job Offer in hand.</p>
